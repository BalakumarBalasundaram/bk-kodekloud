vagrant issues

Workaround for now for me was to disable the VirtualMachinePlatform feature in windows by running:

Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "VirtualMachinePlatform"

When I need to use Docker, I'll re-enable the feature:

Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "VirtualMachinePlatform"

Depending on your setup/Windows version, you may need to use DSIM.


Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All

For Windows 11, you can use an elevated Powershell.

bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
